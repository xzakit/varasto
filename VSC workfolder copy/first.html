      <h1>About me</h1>  
      <p>I'm a hard working and very driven second-year student of Chemical engineering
          at <b>Aalto University</b>. Curiosity and interest in anything and everything
          defines me, as I often find myself taking on new challenges 
          and interests such as programming, photography, reading, and naturally--- <em>Chemistry</em>. 
            <br><br>Using a wide variety of skills, such as a library of five
            languages, and a healthy amount of determination I'm always learning and progressing my way toward <em>success</em>.
            
               <br><br>
               Could <b>you</b> help me in <em>achieving</em> it?
               <br><br>

      <p>
      Let's start off with the obvious. I'm a chemistry enthusiast and naturally as a <b>chemical engineering</b> major, (boasting as of right now a 4,91 GPA)
      I'm educated in the field and I have the necessary <em>skills</em> to work at a <b>laboratory</b> or a <em>factory</em>. Having under my belt
      a year worth of studies, including a licence to work safely in a laboratory as well as multiple courses relating to chemistry 
      and engineering.<br><br>
      Besides studies I also spent my freshman summer as a laboratory assistant at the department of Biosystems and Bioengineering at Aalto University,
      which only further increased my level of knowledge about work related to the chemical industry.

        On top of my <em>university</em> studies I've <b>self taught</b> myself a little bit of <b>programming</b>. My first touch came from a university course which
        included the basics of programming using <b>Scala</b>. My personal interest grew quickly as I started teaching myself through online resources and books.
        Currently I'm taking on <b>web developement</b> (I made this website from scratch!). Languages I've studied include: Scala, Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
        I'm <em>currently</em> planning on taking a minor in <b>computer science</b> to further progress my programming capabilities. <br><br>That and a multitude of projects.<br><br><br>

      <p class=translator>
        Finally, arguably my most honed skill: <b>Languages</b>.<br><br> I speak <b>five</b> different languages and I've used them in a semi-professional setting
        since I was merely <b>10 years old</b>. In 2008 I released my first fully translated children's book called <b>'Pieni Musta Kala'</b> (translates to 'The Little Black Fish') by Samed Behrangi,  which I translated
        to Finnish using Kurdish and English sources. Following that I've done various different translation projects, such as other books, as well as learning materials for various groups.

          <p>I did laboratory work assistance at the department of Biosystems and Biotechnology with various different tasks, the main focus being running quantitative and qualitative analysis for various research groups using machines such as the AEC and GPC. 
              <br><br>My other priority was doing a complete overhaul of the existing chemical storage database, as well as designing brand new labels that vastly improved the ease of future storage, disposal and locating of chemicals, cutting the time spent.
              Due to my well organized work plan, as well as a healthy work ethic, I finished my assignment three times faster than expected saving my worktime for other tasks.

          <p>I've done a large amount of translation work mostly involving educational material, mainly translating to English from Finnish, but also occasionally to Kurdish. I've also translated some books in my past. I currently speak Mandrin, Kurdish, Finnish and English fluently but I'm also slowly teaching myself Swedish and should achieve fluency soon.
